# DF-tools
This repo is a collection of little tools i made while studying mainly to make my life easier.


i am to lazy to make a table, so you have to do with this list:

* The base64 tools folder contains some scripts to validate if a string is base64 and then decode it to see its hidden message.(this will be useless to most of yall, but i makde it and it is part of my journey. so dont care about it, or pretend not to care. THNX!!!)
