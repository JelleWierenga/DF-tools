I made these tools while doing a case study in Autopsy and i found a email containing a string of seemingly random characters. after a good look turned it out to be a basex encoding, i figured it must be base64 acording to the layout of the string.

so i made a tool to check if it is indeed a base64 encoding. then i made the second tool to decode it. i cant put forensic data on here. but the output was a email mesaage for something dark web related.



HOw to use this amazing tool:
glad you asked, just make a input.txt and put your base64 string in there. then run the first tool to check if it is base64, if that is the case. then run the second script to decode it. the output will be in output.txt
